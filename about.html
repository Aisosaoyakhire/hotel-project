                <p>The best hotel I’ve ever been privileged enough to stay at. Gorgeous building, and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk in. High quality rooms (there was even a tv by the shower), and high quality service. Also, they are one of few hotels that allow people under 21 to book a reservation.</p>

                <p> I have stayed at dozen of hotels in the Bahamas. This was on the top of the list of best stays/experiences ever. Staff was very hospitable and there for every need of mine. Thank you so much.</p>
